# TeamTreehouseProjects

This repository will house all of my projects for Team Treehouse. 

The number guessing game prompts users to guess a number 1-10 in the least amount of guesses possible.
While playing a session, the game will record and present your mean, median and mode for the attempts you take to guess correctly.
An overall highscore will be recorded and will be present throughout every playthrough, viewable at the beginning of a game.
